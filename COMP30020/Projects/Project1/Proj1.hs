{- 
  This project was programmed by myself, and was Project 1 for Declaratative
  Programming. Main purpose of this program is to create a guessing game
  for ChordProbe. The aim is to achieve the least amount of guesses to 
  guesses the correct target. This code aims to achieve a lower average
  of guesses to achieve a certain target.
