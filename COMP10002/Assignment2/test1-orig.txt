there once was a lad from enzed
with programming gone to his head
all else he did shove
so that algorithms he could love
and heapsort, he oft said, was incred

that same lad, he did limericks write
it made him feel even more bright
to get those rhymes down
and make everyone frown
when the metre was good (but wasn't quite right)

'twards the end of another great year
when destiny -- and marks -- were come near
our scholar did note
without dis-senting vote
that those skills he could sensibly pair

so he wrote out this terrible poem
as his thinking and daydreams did roam
over hashes and trees
(and the birds and the bees)
with full malloc pain yet to hit home
