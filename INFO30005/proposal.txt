Question 2
* How might we inspire experiences and expressions of gratitude in the workplace

Question 3

What are the different types of people suffering from this problem?
* Many workplace personalities suffer from this problem. Quiet workers who keep
* to themselves may not express gratitude towards other workers. Alot of busy
* workers may not find the time to show their gratitude towards collegues.
* Bosses suffer from this problem, as many workers would feel that they do not
* recieve enough praise from their work.

How prevalent is the problem? How many people are impacted by it?
* Workers suffer from this problem. In 2013, a survey of 2000 workers by the
* John Templelton Foundation showed that 60% of workers never show gratitude
* towards their collegues. Out of these 2000 workers, most felt better when
* someone thanked them for their work. It is clear that expression of gratitude
* towards fellow co-workers is indeed a mood booster. Furthermore, 81% of
* respondents also noted that that they would work harder if their bosses showed
* more gratitude.

What is the economic and social consequences of this problem?
* This problem mainly deals with social consquences. The lack in expression of
* gratitude in the workplace leads to workers feeling undervalued. This then
* causes workers to lose motivation in their work and not perform their best.
* This can also lead to clashes and enimosity between collegues, since workers
* can feel unappreciated and resentment when their work is not being praised. 

What are the possible causes?
* Managers not ackknowledging employees when they perform a task correctly.
* Instead many focus more on critizing mistakes more often.
* Since alot of workers are busy, they do not have the time to express gratitude
* to all their collegues. 
* No real workplace social media for workplace collegues to share ideas and give feedback
* about ideas.

What are the current solutions being explored?
* tapmyback: An app for improving workplace motivation and boosting team
* performace. 
* WooBoard: Employee recognition platform for creating a happy, motivated and
* engaged workplace. 

Question 4

Basic idea
* We want to create a online community for companies where collegues can share
* contributions to the the workplace. These contributions can be stories,
* event organisation, team updates etc. Gratitude can be expressed through the
* quick use of upvoting, favouriting, contructive feedback through
* messaging/commenting on posts This allows coworkers show gratitude in many
* different ways through social media. A good example of the a similar interface would be
* StackOverflow. 

Some Features
* Upvoting contributions
* News feed of current topics in workplace
* Teams should have their own pages, where members of each team are listed
* Moderators will be added to perform tasks
* Many rewards such as site reputation, badges, credits
* Many forms of communication available, such as commenting and messaging
* Chat rooms will be created
* active directory of employees and authentication

Stakeholders
* Companies 
* Startups 
* Businesses
* Any sort of workplace interested in creating a reward based online community
