* Many workplace personalities suffer from this problem. Quiet workers who keep
* to themselves may not express gratitude towards other workers. Alot of busy
* workers may not find the time to show their gratitude towards collegues.
* Bosses suffer from this problem, as many workers would feel that they do not
* recieve enough praise from their work. The list goes on. 


What are the different types of people suffering from this problem?
* Workers suffer from this problem. In 2013, a survey of 2000 workers by the
* John Templelton Foundation showed that 60% of workers never show gratitude
* towards their collegues. Out of these 2000 workers, most felt better when
* someone thanked them for their work. It is clear that expression of gratitude
* towards fellow co-workers is indeed a mood booster. Furthermore, 81% of
* respondents also noted that that they would work harder if their bosses showed
* more gratitude.
